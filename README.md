<h1>SAPIENT Platform - The intelligent way of monitoring CCTVs</h1>

<h3>CCTV ANALYSIS FOR CAMDEN COUNCIL</h3>

The area of Camden its well known for its high levels of criminal activity. The project assigned to our team is related with the CCTV monitoring of the whole Camden Borough. Our client is the Camden Council and they have asked us to develop a software that will use AI(Artificial Intelligence) as well as ML(Machine Learning) to monitor all their CCTVs in order to notice any anti-social behaviour captured by the cameras. 

Our solution is to build three different types of image recognitions, which are Posture, Face and Item. And then, we will apply machine learning to them in order to train the machine to recognise the behaviour and the appearance of objects. After that, we will integrate them into a web application in order to show that the combination of machine learning and image recognitions that we built is truely functional. Finally, we will train the neural network and make it smarter and more accurate over time. 

Our achievement is a web application allowing the machine to perform the image recognition (posture, face and item) on the image, video and live video uploaded by users.
